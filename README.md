### Hi there 👋

<!--
**berthornhill/berthornhill** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Hi. My name is Bert and I am a full stack software engineer with a background in music and higher education. I have a deep passion for all things computers and tech as well as for learning new skills and music. Currently, I’m building in Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, React, Redux but I am always looking to learn more languages and grow as a developer. 

I’m currently seeking a full stack software engineering role where I can utilize my coding skills in impactful and meaningful ways as well as grow as a developer.

As a musician, I've performed and recorded all over the country and world but mostly around New York City. Most recently, I was first horn for the North American Tour of Les Miserables

## Some of my recent projects include:

Bandlamp: A single-page, full stack clone of Bandcamp.com using Ruby, Ruby on Rails, AWS S3, and PostgreSQL for the backend and JavScript, React, Redux on the frontend. 

ProgressSlacker: A “Meme Generator” built with (MERN) MongoDB, Express, React, Node that prioritizes a fun user experience.  

JavaScript-Oscilloscope: An audio and visual sound experience built entirely with JavaScript which utilizes the AudioContextAPI and HTML5 CanvasAPI. Users can create and adjust tones and see a visual rendering of the resultant waveform. 

If you’d like to connect, please reach out!
