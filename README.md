### Hi. My name is Bert and I am a software engineer with a background in music and higher education. I have a deep passion for all things software and tech, music, and to contributing my skills in meaningful and impactful ways.

I'm currently a software engineer at LynxDx where, as part of the Software Team, I contribute to our in-house laboratory information management system, which, through the LynxDx lab in Ann Arbor, MI., currently facilitates tens of thousands of COVID-19 tests weekly for the Greater Detroit Metropolitan Area.

As a musician, I've performed and recorded all over the world. I can be heard on film scores, orchestra albums as well as jazz. I've been heard in concerts from Carnegie Hall to the Blue Note, performing everything from opera to ska. Most recently, I was first horn for the North American Tour of Les Misérables, in which I gave over 500 performances to sold out theaters across the US.

In higher-ed, I worked as the Digital Education Specialist, and Distance Learning Program Coordinator for Manhattan School of Music.

## Some of my recent projects include:

#### JavaScript-Oscilloscope: An audio and visual sound experience built entirely with JavaScript which utilizes the AudioContextAPI and HTML5 CanvasAPI. Users can create and adjust tones and see a visual rendering of the resultant waveform. 

#### Bandlamp: A single-page, full stack clone of Bandcamp.com using Ruby, Ruby on Rails, AWS S3, and PostgreSQL for the backend and JavScript, React, Redux on the frontend. 

#### ProgressSlacker: A “Meme Generator” built with (MERN) MongoDB, Express, React, Node that prioritizes a fun user experience.
